Unifont
=======

Unicode/UTF-8 usage in SDL

This code shows how to use UTF-8 compatible text input and render 
more than 34,000 characters using the bitmap font found on
http://czyborra.com/unifont/HEADER.html
The font renderer is not particularly sophisticated, as it doesn't
support bidirectional text nor combining characters (diacritics),
but it supports the double-width characters found in the above font.
For desktop application use, there are already much better decoders
and renderers around, but this might just be the simple piece of code
to i18nize your SDL game font.

Usage
-----

Build the program with make. Look at the code in unifont.c.
Use buildunifont.sh to create a header file from the hex font that
you can statically include in your code (use the header instead
of the openfile() call in the code).
